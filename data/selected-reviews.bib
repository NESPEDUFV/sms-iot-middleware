  abstract  = {Due to the rising popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT), interconnected infrastructures with better flexibility and efficiency are being developed for industry 4.0. The use of IoT in industry 4.0 introduces a new term 'Industrial IoT (IIoT)', which allows remote monitoring of wide-ranging industrial processes. IIoT tends to function with a large number of heterogeneous devices, therefore, data interoperability is the biggest challenge in achieving seamless real-Time communication. To achieve data interoperability, there is a need to integrate various IoT application layer protocols; separately, as well as, with other data acquisition protocols along with hardware/software platforms. Although such integrations are frequently presented in the state-of-The-Art, a comprehensive investigation and analysis of such approaches in single research work are hard to find. Therefore, in this article, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is presented by investigating 34 influential research works, published during 2014-2020, where interoperability of application layer protocols is performed for IIoT. Consequently, the selected research studies are divided into three categories: 1) Integration of IoT application layer protocols-13 papers; 2) Integration of IoT and data acquisition protocols-6 papers; 3) Integration of IoT protocols with hardware/software platforms-15 papers to resolve interoperability issues. Moreover, nineteen (19) tools used for integration in the selected research works are identified. Furthermore, leading approaches to perform such integrations are recognized, e.g., Gateways. It has been concluded that although researchers frequently propose centralized (e.g., gateway or protocol converter) and distributed intermediator (e.g., Middleware) to achieve required interoperability for IIoT, it is a need of a day to develop a device level solution without the involvement of intermediator. This will solve different interoperability problems in industries like scalability, load balancing, and a single point of failure.  © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Internet of Things (IoT) offers complex networks of connected devices, which are used to serve in the real-time environment. Interestingly, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) play as one of the major components to observe environment in real-time. Although, IoT is being used in diverse applications and services, which involve heterogeneity and interoperability that make it more complex as compared to traditional networks. Further, to take-care of these issues middleware coalesce as a software technology by supporting interoperability, heterogeneous computing, and communication. So, middleware can be used in various IoT applications by extending the WSNs as a services. With this reference, we provide a survey on WSNs middlewares towards IoT to provide a comparative view of various middlewares and how this middleware technology can be used to incorporate several problems arise in the development of IoT applications.

  abstract  = {An enormous amount of sensing devices (scalar or multimedia) collect and generate information (in the form of events) over the Internet of Things (IoT). Present research on IoT mainly focus on the processing of scalar sensor data events and barely considers the challenges posed by multimedia based events. In this paper, we systematically review the existing solutions available for the Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) by analyzing sensing, networking, service, and application-level services provided by IoT. We present state-of-the-art event-based middleware methods and their suitability for multimedia event processing methods. We observe that existing IoT event-based middleware solutions focus on structured (scalar) events and possess only domain-specific characteristics for unstructured (multimedia) events. A case study for object detection is also presented to demonstrate the requirements associated with the processing of multimedia events within smart cities, even with common image recognition based applications. In order to validate the existing issues in the detection of objects, we also presented an evaluation of object detection models using existing datasets. At the end of each section, we shed light on trends, gaps, and possible solutions based on our analysis, experiments, and review of the existing research. Finally, we summarize the challenges and future research directions for the generalized multimedia event processing (by taking detection of each and every object as an example) based on applications using IoMT. Our experiments demonstrate that existing models are very slow to respond to any unseen class, and existing rich datasets do not have a sufficient number of classes to meet the requirements of real-time applications of smart cities. We show that although there is a significantly large technical literature on IoT, and research on IoMT is also quite actively growing, there have not been much research efforts directed towards the processing of multimedia events. As an example, although deep learning techniques have been shown to achieve impressive performance in applications like image recognition, the methods are deficient in detecting new (previously unseen) objects for multimedia based applications in smart cities. In light of these facts, it becomes imperative to conduct research on bringing together the abilities of event-based middleware for IoMT, and low response-time based online training and adaptation techniques. © 2020 The Authors},

  abstract  = {Internet of Things (IoT) is characterized as one of the leading actors for the next evolutionary stage in the computing world. IoT-based applications have already produced a plethora of novel services and are improving the living standard by enabling innovative and smart solutions. However, along with its rapid adoption, IoT technology also creates complex challenges regarding the management of IoT networks due to its resource limitations (computational power, energy, and security). Hence, it is urgently needed to refine the IoT-based application's architectures to robustly manage the overall IoT infrastructure. Software-defined networking (SDN) has emerged as a paradigm that offers software-based controllers to manage hardware infrastructure and traffic flow on a network effectively. SDN architecture has the potential to provide efficient and reliable IoT network management. This research provides a comprehensive survey investigating the published studies on SDN-based frameworks to address IoT management issues in the dimensions of fault tolerance, energy management, scalability, load balancing, and security service provisioning within the IoT networks. We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the research studies (published from 2010 to 2022) focusing on SDN-based IoT management frameworks. We provide an extensive discussion on various aspects of SDN-based IoT solutions and architectures. We elaborate a taxonomy of the existing SDN-based IoT frameworks and solutions by classifying them into categories such as network function virtualization, middleware, OpenFlow adaptation, and blockchain-based management. We present the research gaps by identifying and analyzing the key architectural requirements and management issues in IoT infrastructures. Finally, we highlight various challenges and a range of promising opportunities for future research to provide a roadmap for addressing the weaknesses and identifying the benefits from the potentials offered by SDN-based IoT solutions.  © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Middleware platforms are key technology in any Internet of Things (IoT) system, considering their role in managing the intermediary communications between devices and applications. In the energy sector, it has been shown that IoT devices enable the integration of all network assets to one large distributed system. This comes with significant benefits, such as improving energy efficiency, boosting the generation of renewable energy, reducing maintenance costs and increasing comfort. Various existing IoT middlware solutions encounter several problems that limit their performance, such as vendor locks. Hence, this paper presents a literature review and an expert survey on IoT middleware platforms in energy systems, in order to provide a set of tools and functionalities to be supported by any future efficient, flexible and interoperable IoT middleware considering the market needs. The analysis of the results shows that experts currently use the IoT middleware mainly to deploy services such as visualization, monitoring and benchmarking of energy consumption, and energy optimization is considered as a future application to target. Likewise, non-functional requirements, such as security and privacy, play vital roles in the IoT platforms’ performances. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Actuators implement in the physical world application needs. The role of software is increasing as more and more resources become virtualized and software-defined. Smart environment is an emerging concept that has the potential to address many of the humanity problems. In this context, what are the promising tools for building the smart environments of the future? This paper provides a review of platforms, middleware, and frameworks that can help in this big challenge, discussing their architectures, service life-cycling, digital twins, cloud-based operation, virtualization, security, privacy, communication model, support for AI and machine learning, among other aspects. The proposed revision innovates by employing previous work on future Internet key enablers as parameters for qualitative comparisons. The idea is to determine the degree of alignment among current initiatives for smart environments and the ones emerging from future Internet research. Among the main conclusions are: (i) heterogeneity come to stay; (ii) many contemporary proposals do not cover important aspects raised in future Internet research; (iii) publish/subscribe model is largely employed; (iv) many proposals are stuck to the limitations of current Internet model (another reason to explore the relationship among current platforms and previous future Internet research for IoT); (v) devices interoperability is a problem solved; (vi) ingredients from future Internet research, such as SDN/NFV, ICN and SCN are systematically being adopted for smart environments design. Many others are to come; (vii) AI, machine learning, and big data support are missing not only in TCP/IP-based approaches, but also in future Internet-based. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {An important increase in the number of smart things, connected objects, smartphones, and sensors are founded every day, creating a huge amount of data called Big Data. Because of the dynamism of things and the limited capability of their resources and services to process and store this huge data, Cloud computing became an efficient, accessible, and reasonable solution. IoT in combination with Cloud functionalities provides a new phenomenon called the Cloud of Things (CoT) where many new possibilities are enabled. With the heterogeneity of different objects, the dynamism of their context, their distribution and the infinite cloud services, a middleware is a key solution. The main aim of this paper is to study middleware for self-adaptation of the Cloud of things environment into the context of objects. Toward this end, we first present some related features. Next, we compare some middlewares according to their characteristics. Then, we present some middlewares for static and dynamic adaptation and finally, we conclude this paper with a list of current challenges and issues in the design of a new middleware able to adapt dynamically and in execution time any cloud service into the context of the current object. © 2022 The Authors.

Although there is a significant existing body of work related to IoT middleware, there is, as yet, no complementary overview of the state of the art on how these platforms can contribute to energy efficiency and energy awareness in IoT systems. This paper provides such an overview in the form of a systematic literature review (SLR). The SLR was carried out by following a systematic, rigorous procedure to search, select, and analyze primary studies available in the literature. Our corpus, as presented in this paper, is made up of twenty-two such studies, each presenting strategies and solutions on middleware support for energy efficiency and energy awareness in IoT systems. These strategies mainly focus on network adaptation, task offloading, and concrete implementations. However, most of these studies do not consider energy-aware/efficiency abstractions, and focus on solutions working at the end-user application side. In conclusion, this paper also raises relevant challenges and potential directions for further research resulting from the main SLR findings. © 2022, Institut Mines-Télécom and Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract  = {Context-aware computing enriches the capabilities of intelligent devices complemented with smart applications and helps establish smart ecosystems in fields such as Ambient Intelligence, Internet of Things, Mobile Computing, and Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing. Though the literature has many surveys that outline existing systems, it still remains critical to elucidate the basics of actually building an effective context-aware ecosystem. We outline the basic components required and essential for the same. We believe that a context-aware ecosystem becomes effective when these components are designed and implemented effectively. We call it the MOM of context-aware systems: generic and effective context Modeling, an efficient context Organization, and a robust context Middleware. Context modeling affords a syntax to the raw pieces of relevant information, the organization mechanism furnishes semantic import to the information and relationships, and the middleware compiles and integrates the information, enabling sharing of context. We discuss various context-aware ecosystems and middleware from the literature and highlight how the three building components function in each case. This paper will benefit newcomers to the field who are looking to learn about and build context-aware ecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract  = {Purpose: Internet has changed radically in the way people interact in the virtual world, in their careers or social relationships. IoT technology has added a new vision to this process by enabling connections between smart objects and humans, and also between smart objects themselves, which leads to anything, anytime, anywhere, and any media communications. IoT allows objects to physically see, hear, think, and perform tasks by making them talk to each other, share information and coordinate decisions. To enable the vision of IoT, it utilizes technologies such as ubiquitous computing, context awareness, RFID, WSN, embedded devices, CPS, communication technologies, and internet protocols. IoT is considered to be the future internet, which is significantly different from the Internet we use today. The purpose of this paper is to provide up-to-date literature on trends of IoT research which is driven by the need for convergence of several interdisciplinary technologies and new applications. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive IoT literature review has been performed in this paper as a survey. The survey starts by providing an overview of IoT concepts, visions and evolutions. IoT architectures are also explored. Then, the most important components of IoT are discussed including a thorough discussion of IoT operating systems such as Tiny OS, Contiki OS, FreeRTOS, and RIOT. A review of IoT applications is also presented in this paper and finally, IoT challenges that can be recently encountered by researchers are introduced. Findings: Studies of IoT literature and projects show the disproportionate importance of technology in IoT projects, which are often driven by technological interventions rather than innovation in the business model. There are a number of serious concerns about the dangers of IoT growth, particularly in the areas of privacy and security; hence, industry and government began addressing these concerns. At the end, what makes IoT exciting is that we do not yet know the exact use cases which would have the ability to significantly influence our lives. Originality/value: This survey provides a comprehensive literature review on IoT techniques, operating systems and trends. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

  abstract  = {Satisfying a context consumer’s quality of context (QoC) requirements is of utmost importance to context management platforms (CMPs)in order to have credibility. QoC indicates the contextual information’s quality metrics (e.g., accuracy, timeliness, completeness). The outcomes of these metrics depend on the functional and quality characteristics associated with all actors (context consumers (or) context-aware applications, CMPs, and context providers (or) IoT-data providers) in context-aware ecosystems. This survey identifies and studies such characteristics and highlights the limitations in actors’ current functionalities and QoC modelling approaches to obtain adequate QoC and improve context consumers’ quality of experience (QoE). We propose an abstract system based on deductions from this study; this system addresses the functional limitations in existing QoC modelling approaches. Moreover, we have also highlighted those QoC metrics affected by quality of service (QoS) metrics in CMPs. These recommendations provide CMP developers with a reference framework they could incorporate and a list of QoS metrics that they need in order to maintain an adequate QoC. © 2022 by the authors.

  abstract  = {Ubiquitous sensing, provided via wireless sensor networks technologies, disseminates across many domains of contemporary day living. This provides the ability to sense, process, analyze and infer environmental parameters from natural resources and delicate ecologies to urban environments. The explosion in the number of devices that are connected to the internet has led to the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) technological revolution. In these technologies, actuators and sensors incorporate smoothly with the IoT environment. Furthermore, the sensed data is shared through platforms to innovate a common operating picture. This cutting-edge technology is fueled by a diversity of IoT devices that enables technologies such as near field communication, embedded actuator, sensor nodes, radio frequency identification tags, and readers. IoT has emerged from its infancy and has established a fully integrated future internet. Different visions of IoT technologies have been reviewed, however, what emerges currently in this field should be faced and displayed via the research community. In this paper, we are keen to discuss the recent worldwide implementation of IoT, where the prime enabling technologies, recent and future communication protocols and application areas that drive IoT research in the near future are explored. Furthermore, the original, recent, future enhancements of all IoT stack's protocols are extensively discussed. Middleware's definition, usages, types and open research challenges are further illustrated. Not only to this extent but rather, this survey details the simulation tools of IoT networks, IoT sensors along with their recent application areas, broad IoT research challenges, as well as in-depth analysis of IoT research history and recommendations that attract current IoT researchers' attention. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract  = {Internet of Things (IoT) is highly heterogeneous in terms of devices, communication technologies, protocols, data formats, and semantics. Data generated from various sources are represented using different semantics. It makes semantic interoperability as one of the significant issues in provisioning seamless communication and services over diverse IoT platforms. Semantic models help in exchanging semantically annotated information among such heterogeneous applications in a meaningful way. Seamless communication among different types of applications is commonly accomplished by using middleware, ontology, and semantic web technologies. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of different semantic interoperability solutions in the context of IoT. The pivotal semantic models available in the literature are compared with the help of a classification framework. This study identifies various open research issues and challenges for facilitating interoperable IoT communications. For the purpose of implementation and performance evaluation of various semantic models, we also suggest some important tools and frameworks. After pointing out different prospects and problems of the existing semantic interoperability schemes, the factors for improvement are identified indicating future research directions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION: The world population is living longer than ever before, Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) research try to ensure people are ageing well by using digital and physical technologies. The development of AAL platforms presents several challenges (e.g., sensor data integration, device interoperability). Many requirements for AAL platforms can be met by using the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing paradigm standards. METHODOLOGY: In this paper, we conducted a systematic mapping of the literature on AAL platforms to investigate the correlation between these three paradigms. We focused on AAL platforms that use IoT and Cloud Computing concepts to meet their requirements. Our primary research question is "What are the requirements of AAL platforms in the IoT Era and their relationship with IoT standards?". We defined as the scope of our systematic mapping the primary studies about AAL platforms published between 2013 to 2017, and we used seven indexed electronic databases. RESULTS: We obtained 35 papers whose AAL platforms developed using IoT or Cloud Computing standards. We then analyse and correlate the requirements, architectures, and evaluation types presented by these platforms. We found patterns by connecting specific requirements with platform design. We believe these results assist AAL developers and architectural designers in the creation of new AAL platforms and applications.},

New actors that aim to remotely monitor and control home devices such as heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), light bulbs, or distributed energy resources (e.g., batteries, PV panels…) have come into play. However, transitioning from isolated often not interoperable home automation systems to open, yet secure, solutions that integrate external sources of information and cloud computing to make a more efficient use of energy, is not trivial. It requires designing and implementing hierarchical architectures and standard solutions to facilitate interoperability, one of the challenges of cross-domain smart-city applications as no standard solution has been established yet. Even though most solutions share a set of building blocks that have fostered the appearance of Internet of Things (IoT) middlewares to accelerate development, most existing energy platforms are still tailor-made for specific applications. This paper targets three audiences. First, for those interested in using or selecting an energy platform, the study carries out a comparative analysis of some of the most popular alternatives. Second, for those that are considering building new energy platforms, this paper analyzes the necessary hierarchical blocks, and the main design options and strategies. Finally, for those interested in comparing platforms, a new set of IoT levels that evaluate the adoption of IoT technologies is proposed.},

  abstract = {Smart city middleware serves as a foundational tool in the evolution of urban digitalization, acting as an intermediary software layer that simplifies the development, deployment, and management of applications tailored for smart urban environments. However, the development of effective middleware for smart cities is challenging. The present research embarks on a comprehensive exploration of the smart city middleware landscape, unraveling the intricacies of its development and the challenges faced therein. Rooted in the assessment of 20 distinct middleware solutions, our study highlights the pivotal technologies, features and functionalities that are imperative for a middleware to effectively support a city’s digital transformation. The functional and non-functional requirements form the nucleus of our evaluation. We also explore the architectural styles pivotal to middleware development and the programming paradigms shaping smart city application development. Our study highlights challenges in using middleware for smart city applications, such as interoperability, scalability, security amidst big data, context management, reliability, quality of service, energy efficiency, and compliance with technological standards and regulations. Based on the detailed analysis, we propose a conceptual framework for smart city middleware, shaped by the challenges and requirements identified in existing literature and middleware solutions. This framework is designed to reflect the diverse demands and complexities of urban digital transformation, and guide smart city middleware development accordingly. As a result, this research stands as a reference study for software developers, urban planners, and researchers, outlining the current state and future directions in the domain of smart city middleware.},
