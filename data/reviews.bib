  abstract  = {Due to the rising popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT), interconnected infrastructures with better flexibility and efficiency are being developed for industry 4.0. The use of IoT in industry 4.0 introduces a new term 'Industrial IoT (IIoT)', which allows remote monitoring of wide-ranging industrial processes. IIoT tends to function with a large number of heterogeneous devices, therefore, data interoperability is the biggest challenge in achieving seamless real-Time communication. To achieve data interoperability, there is a need to integrate various IoT application layer protocols; separately, as well as, with other data acquisition protocols along with hardware/software platforms. Although such integrations are frequently presented in the state-of-The-Art, a comprehensive investigation and analysis of such approaches in single research work are hard to find. Therefore, in this article, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is presented by investigating 34 influential research works, published during 2014-2020, where interoperability of application layer protocols is performed for IIoT. Consequently, the selected research studies are divided into three categories: 1) Integration of IoT application layer protocols-13 papers; 2) Integration of IoT and data acquisition protocols-6 papers; 3) Integration of IoT protocols with hardware/software platforms-15 papers to resolve interoperability issues. Moreover, nineteen (19) tools used for integration in the selected research works are identified. Furthermore, leading approaches to perform such integrations are recognized, e.g., Gateways. It has been concluded that although researchers frequently propose centralized (e.g., gateway or protocol converter) and distributed intermediator (e.g., Middleware) to achieve required interoperability for IIoT, it is a need of a day to develop a device level solution without the involvement of intermediator. This will solve different interoperability problems in industries like scalability, load balancing, and a single point of failure.  © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {The development of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), big data, and artificial intelligence technologies is leading to a major change in the production system. The change is being propagated into the wave of transforming the existing system with a vertical structure into the corresponding horizontal platform or middleware. Accordingly, the way of acquiring IIoT data from an individual system is being altered to the way of being increasingly centralized through an integrated middleware of a scalable server or through a large platform. That said, middleware-based IIoT data acquisition must consider multiple factors, such as infrastructure (e.g., operation environment and network), protocol heterogeneity, interoperability (e.g., links with legacy systems), real-time, and security. This manuscript explains these five aspects in detail and provides a taxonomy of eighteen state-of-the-art IIoT data-acquisition middleware systems based on these aspects. To validate one of these aspects (network), we present our evaluation results at a real production site where IIoT data-acquisition loss rates are compared between wireless (long-term evolution) and wired networks. As a result, the wired communication can be more suitable for centralized IIoT data-acquisition middleware than wireless networks. Finally, we discuss several challenges in establishing the best IIoT data-acquisition middleware in a centralized way.  © 2021 Jin-Sung Ok et al.},

Although, IoT is being used in diverse applications and services, which involve heterogeneity and interoperability that make it more complex as compared to traditional networks. Further, to take-care of these issues middleware coalesce as a software technology by supporting interoperability, heterogeneous computing, and communication. So, middleware can be used in various IoT applications by extending the WSNs as a services. With this reference, we provide a survey on WSNs middlewares towards IoT to provide a comparative view of various middlewares and how this middleware technology can be used to incorporate several problems arise in the development of IoT applications.

  abstract  = {The Internet of Things is becoming a key element of the future Internet and a vital national and international infrastructure, so that it seems that the introduction of the Internet of Things in libraries is imminent and inevitable. Therefore, the identification of the architecture of using the Internet of Things in Iranian academic libraries is the most important concern and the main problem of the present research, which according to the searches carried out so far, the comprehensive architecture based on the systematic review of studies, architectures, previous models and the combination of findings they have been designed, it has not been presented for university libraries in Iran, so this research can be the beginning of exploiting this emerging technology. Based on the purpose, the type of research is developmental-applied, and in terms of the execution path, meta-composite, survey-analytical methods and the approval of subject experts have been used. The databases of Elsevier, Scopus, Emerald, LISTA, IEEE Xplore, Magiran, Noor Specialized Journals Database, Civilica, University Jihad Scientific Information Center Database, and Google Scholar Search Engine were reviewed. In the first stage, after reviewing the mentioned databases, the researchers extracted the components and indicators of IoT application, which have 9 components (building, management, users, librarians, lending, reading room, reference, cataloging, information literacy) and 31 Indicators for architectural were identified. In order to confirm these components and indicators from the point of view of the target community (administrators of university libraries in Iran), a researcher’s checklist was sent to them. By meaning of these libraries we mean the central libraries of comprehensive universities, which were studied in the census method and after examining the results of the one-sample t-test, it was determined that all the components and indicators for use in university libraries in Iran are approved by the society. The target is located. Then, with a comprehensive review of these previous researches, a proposed architecture that is comprehensive and clear was designed and approved by experts in the field of Internet of Things. The proposed architecture consists of five layers: device, network, middleware, services, and security and privacy, and the working method of each layer is described. If the managers of these libraries have a desire to use the Internet of Things, they can use this proposed architecture for the basic principles of their work. © 2022 Iranian Research Institute for Scientific Information and Documentation.

  abstract  = {An enormous amount of sensing devices (scalar or multimedia) collect and generate information (in the form of events) over the Internet of Things (IoT). Present research on IoT mainly focus on the processing of scalar sensor data events and barely considers the challenges posed by multimedia based events. In this paper, we systematically review the existing solutions available for the Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) by analyzing sensing, networking, service, and application-level services provided by IoT. We present state-of-the-art event-based middleware methods and their suitability for multimedia event processing methods. We observe that existing IoT event-based middleware solutions focus on structured (scalar) events and possess only domain-specific characteristics for unstructured (multimedia) events. A case study for object detection is also presented to demonstrate the requirements associated with the processing of multimedia events within smart cities, even with common image recognition based applications. In order to validate the existing issues in the detection of objects, we also presented an evaluation of object detection models using existing datasets. At the end of each section, we shed light on trends, gaps, and possible solutions based on our analysis, experiments, and review of the existing research. Finally, we summarize the challenges and future research directions for the generalized multimedia event processing (by taking detection of each and every object as an example) based on applications using IoMT. Our experiments demonstrate that existing models are very slow to respond to any unseen class, and existing rich datasets do not have a sufficient number of classes to meet the requirements of real-time applications of smart cities. We show that although there is a significantly large technical literature on IoT, and research on IoMT is also quite actively growing, there have not been much research efforts directed towards the processing of multimedia events. As an example, although deep learning techniques have been shown to achieve impressive performance in applications like image recognition, the methods are deficient in detecting new (previously unseen) objects for multimedia based applications in smart cities. In light of these facts, it becomes imperative to conduct research on bringing together the abilities of event-based middleware for IoMT, and low response-time based online training and adaptation techniques. © 2020 The Authors},

  abstract  = {Among the main problems faced in the context of electric mobility today, the management and monitoring of electric vehicle charging stations, the integration between the diverse types of technologies that make up its architecture, and its low scalability stand out. Therefore, we will present the implementation and complete integration of an electric vehicle charging system in an electric mobility pilot project being executed in the Amazon region in Brazil. Therefore, a literature review of related works will be presented, and its entire implementation will be addressed, from the charging infrastructure, through its back-end system and its Internet of things platform, to its front-end web system for monitoring charging stations. In addition, a complete prototype is created with a real testbed to verify the scalability of the implemented physical system. Based on the testbed evaluations performed, we observe that the implemented system performs well in receiving and sending data from up to 160 electric vehicle charging stations, achieving an average consumption of 26% for CPU and 95% for memory. In addition, it is important to mention that the deployed system supports horizontal scalability, enabling the connection of more charging stations and making it ideal for other integrated systems similar to ours. Based upon the main results obtained with the implemented system, the possibility of carrying out the management and monitoring of charging stations stands out; the integration of different technologies, from the back end and IoT middleware to its front end; a system that supports scalability, enabling the connection of more charging stations; and a reference architecture for charging station management and monitoring systems for the Amazon region. © 2022 by the authors.},

This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones, intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered, and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption, network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management. © 2020 The Authors},

  abstract  = {With the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data, emerging applications that cross stacks with different techniques bring new challenges to parallel computing systems. These cross-stack functionalities require one system to possess multiple characteristics, such as the ability to process data under high throughput and low latency, the ability to carry out iterative and incremental computation, transparent fault tolerance, and the ability to perform heterogeneous tasks that evolve dynamically. However, high-performance computing (HPC) and big data computing, as two categories of parallel computing architecture, are incapable of meeting all these requirements. Therefore, by performing a comparative analysis of HPC and big data computing from the perspective of the parallel programming model layer, middleware layer, and infrastructure layer, we explore the design principles of the two architectures and discuss a converged architecture to address the abovementioned challenges. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Based on the idea of the use case specification technique in software engineering, our language provides users with a natural language like syntax to allow them to specify when or under what conditions they want which objects to be connected. To support this language, we have also developed a transformation mechanism that automatically translates users' specification into the source code. We have evaluated this language through an experiment and a survey. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) a simple natural language that enables the users to specify which objects to connect and when and 2) a transformation mechanism that automatically translates users' specifications into source code and dynamically attaches the code to relevant applications.

  abstract  = {Internet of Things (IoT) is characterized as one of the leading actors for the next evolutionary stage in the computing world. IoT-based applications have already produced a plethora of novel services and are improving the living standard by enabling innovative and smart solutions. However, along with its rapid adoption, IoT technology also creates complex challenges regarding the management of IoT networks due to its resource limitations (computational power, energy, and security). Hence, it is urgently needed to refine the IoT-based application's architectures to robustly manage the overall IoT infrastructure. Software-defined networking (SDN) has emerged as a paradigm that offers software-based controllers to manage hardware infrastructure and traffic flow on a network effectively. SDN architecture has the potential to provide efficient and reliable IoT network management. This research provides a comprehensive survey investigating the published studies on SDN-based frameworks to address IoT management issues in the dimensions of fault tolerance, energy management, scalability, load balancing, and security service provisioning within the IoT networks. We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the research studies (published from 2010 to 2022) focusing on SDN-based IoT management frameworks. We provide an extensive discussion on various aspects of SDN-based IoT solutions and architectures. We elaborate a taxonomy of the existing SDN-based IoT frameworks and solutions by classifying them into categories such as network function virtualization, middleware, OpenFlow adaptation, and blockchain-based management. We present the research gaps by identifying and analyzing the key architectural requirements and management issues in IoT infrastructures. Finally, we highlight various challenges and a range of promising opportunities for future research to provide a roadmap for addressing the weaknesses and identifying the benefits from the potentials offered by SDN-based IoT solutions.  © 2013 IEEE.},

After the survey, this chapter will present a typology of current ubiquitous learning applications and map this typology to the various components of the IoT stack. Representative ubiquitous learning systems in the areas of language and social sciences learning, science and technology learning, and domain independent learning will be considered. Thirdly, based on recent trends in IoT technologies, new architectures and future, prospects for IoT-based ubiquitous learning applications will be explored. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract  = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a network paradigm in which physical, digital, and virtual objects are equipped with identification, detection, networking, and processing functions to communicate with each other and with other devices and services on the Internet in order to perform the users’ required tasks. Many IoT applications are provided to bring comfort and facilitate the human life. In addition, the application of IoT technologies in the automotive industry has given rise to the concept of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) which facilitated using of Cyber Physic Systems, in which machines and humans interact. Due to the diversity, heterogeneity, and large volume of data generated by these entities, the use of traditional database management systems is not suitable in general. In the design of IoT data management systems, many distinctive principles should be considered. These different principles allowed the proposal of several approaches for IoT data management. Some middleware or architecture-oriented solutions facilitate the integration of generated data. Other available solutions provide efficient storage and indexing structured and unstructured data as well as the support to the NoSQL language. Thus, this paper identifies the most relevant concepts of data management in IoT, surveys the current solutions proposed for IoT data management, discusses the most promising solutions, and identifies relevant open research issues on the topic providing guidelines for further contributions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract  = {Interoperability is a functionality that facilitates integration amongst disparate devices and systems used by applications. Integration, inter-operability, middleware, and standardization are some of the synonyms or solutions of interoperability. As such, interoperability facilitates timely, efficient, and effective completion of applications, in addition to finding new, smarter, and more adaptive services. Smart cities, like many other environments and applications, suffer from the lack of interoperability, which makes their processing very challenging. The lack of interoperability also leads to ineffectiveness, which is highly undesirable for applications that deal with emergencies or have exceptional requirements. In particular, interoperability is highly desirable in heterogeneous systems. This research presents a comprehensive review of the available methods and ways to deal with the issues related to interoperability. In addition, the article provides a classification of the available solutions to overcome the lack of interoperability. Various methods which claim to provide interoperability, are sorted out according to the domains and context in which they appear. This research has identified the advantages and limitations of the available methods for facilitating interoperability. A comprehensive framework for dealing with Interoperability in different domains is proposed. This framework provides a hybrid approach for dealing with interoperability, which could be regarded as a comprehensive and reliable solution when dealing with smart cities.  © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {The exponential growth in Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the limitations of cloud computing in terms of latency and quality of service for time-sensitive applications have led to the unfolding of the efficient middleware technology called fog. Fog computing circumvents the limitations of the cloud by creating a seamless continuum between the things/IoT/end-user devices and the cloud and reducing the effective distance. However, fog computing faces challenges for offloading tasks for their remote computation at some level. Hence, the optimality of task offloading is the primary research area in fog computing. Several contemporary papers exist on this important subject. The research gap in reviewing all these task offloading algorithms has motivated us for their presentation in the form of a detailed survey in this paper. There exist some survey papers which deal with the task offloading. However, none of them has covered the basics of optimization techniques and their solution approaches. The primary objective of this paper is to provide the readers with a complete overview of the journey from a task offloading idea to its mathematical problem formulation and finally to its solution with all details of optimization techniques. We begin by introducing fog computing, and task offloading process followed by several task offloading factors governing decision-making process and their surveys. A section is fully dedicated to the survey of offloading objectives with examples. We also present several optimization approaches used in task offloading. Finally, the last section dedicates to the challenges and future direction in fog computing. The outcomes of the survey will benefit readers in learning the optimization used in task offloading, and it will also provide them a systematic design of offloading scheme with specific objectives. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract  = {– The rapid evolution of technology has paved the way for the many applications of the Internet of Things (IoT). As IoT systems become increasingly complex, new technologies that simplify the development of the IoT are emerging, for example, IoT cloud platforms have gained popularity as tools that reduce development time and cut costs. Recent surveys indicate that only a few IoT projects have had successful outcomes. Among the main reasons for this, there is the lack of knowledge regarding IoT design and architecture. Numerous research studies have tried to address the problem of choosing the right cloud platform based on specific requirements, but none of the reviewed studies has proposed a cost-benefit analysis of the current available cloud solutions for the IoT. Here, the IoT has been studied from a decision-maker’s perspective, giving a brief but concise introduction to modern IoT architecture and IoT middleware and evaluating the costs of four popular IoT cloud middleware solutions under different project requirements and design scenarios. © 2022 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {Middleware platforms are key technology in any Internet of Things (IoT) system, considering their role in managing the intermediary communications between devices and applications. In the energy sector, it has been shown that IoT devices enable the integration of all network assets to one large distributed system. This comes with significant benefits, such as improving energy efficiency, boosting the generation of renewable energy, reducing maintenance costs and increasing comfort. Various existing IoT middlware solutions encounter several problems that limit their performance, such as vendor locks. Hence, this paper presents a literature review and an expert survey on IoT middleware platforms in energy systems, in order to provide a set of tools and functionalities to be supported by any future efficient, flexible and interoperable IoT middleware considering the market needs. The analysis of the results shows that experts currently use the IoT middleware mainly to deploy services such as visualization, monitoring and benchmarking of energy consumption, and energy optimization is considered as a future application to target. Likewise, non-functional requirements, such as security and privacy, play vital roles in the IoT platforms’ performances. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

  abstract  = {The cloud of things (CloudIoT) represents a general system of supporting infrastructure for storing and processing information gathered from smart objects and their communications.There are many resources used to respond to requests in the CloudIoT environment. Therefore, a primary challenge in these systems is resource discovery based on the requests. Discovering and accessing resources, overcoming user constraints, and focusing on dynamic requirements, such as failure nodes, are the most critical issues to be addressed. This paper focuses on several resource discovery mechanisms using the systematic literature review method in the CloudIoT environment. The research aims at analyzing and reviewing studies published from 2016 to 2021 (June) on resource discovery in CloudIoT. The technical classification of resource discovery is based on selected studies by considering architecture, algorithm, middleware, and protocol approaches. These studies are discussed in terms of their main ideas, advantages, and weaknesses. Finally, future research opportunities related to resource discovery in the cloud of things are identified. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract  = {Internet of things (IoT) is pushing the integration of physical and virtual worlds. Sensor devices provide rich sensory information to context-aware services. Actuators implement in the physical world application needs. The role of software is increasing as more and more resources become virtualized and software-defined. Smart environment is an emerging concept that has the potential to address many of the humanity problems. In this context, what are the promising tools for building the smart environments of the future? This paper provides a review of platforms, middleware, and frameworks that can help in this big challenge, discussing their architectures, service life-cycling, digital twins, cloud-based operation, virtualization, security, privacy, communication model, support for AI and machine learning, among other aspects. The proposed revision innovates by employing previous work on future Internet key enablers as parameters for qualitative comparisons. The idea is to determine the degree of alignment among current initiatives for smart environments and the ones emerging from future Internet research. Among the main conclusions are: (i) heterogeneity come to stay; (ii) many contemporary proposals do not cover important aspects raised in future Internet research; (iii) publish/subscribe model is largely employed; (iv) many proposals are stuck to the limitations of current Internet model (another reason to explore the relationship among current platforms and previous future Internet research for IoT); (v) devices interoperability is a problem solved; (vi) ingredients from future Internet research, such as SDN/NFV, ICN and SCN are systematically being adopted for smart environments design. Many others are to come; (vii) AI, machine learning, and big data support are missing not only in TCP/IP-based approaches, but also in future Internet-based. © 2013 IEEE.},

Because of the dynamism of things and the limited capability of their resources and services to process and store this huge data, Cloud computing became an efficient, accessible, and reasonable solution. IoT in combination with Cloud functionalities provides a new phenomenon called the Cloud of Things (CoT) where many new possibilities are enabled. With the heterogeneity of different objects, the dynamism of their context, their distribution and the infinite cloud services, a middleware is a key solution. The main aim of this paper is to study middleware for self-adaptation of the Cloud of things environment into the context of objects. Toward this end, we first present some related features. Next, we compare some middlewares according to their characteristics. Then, we present some middlewares for static and dynamic adaptation and finally, we conclude this paper with a list of current challenges and issues in the design of a new middleware able to adapt dynamically and in execution time any cloud service into the context of the current object. © 2022 The Authors.

Current issues like the latest technologies, smartphones, intelligent management of WSN, middleware platforms etc. protrude because they have the power to transform arable farming into smart arable farming. For implementation, various challenges are encountered and interoperability is major hurdle throughout the architecture of the IoT system, which can be discussed by shared standards and protocols.

  abstract  = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is characterized by a myriad of physical deices, together with high heterogeneity in both software and hardware. Middleware platforms have been proposed in order to alleviate such heterogeneity, providing relevant services and easing application development. In IoT systems, energy consumption is a key concern due to the proliferation of devices and their limited battery capacity. IoT middleware platforms can play an important role in providing applications with strategies, and support, for energy awareness and energy efficiency. Although there is a significant existing body of work related to IoT middleware, there is, as yet, no complementary overview of the state of the art on how these platforms can contribute to energy efficiency and energy awareness in IoT systems. This paper provides such an overview in the form of a systematic literature review (SLR). The SLR was carried out by following a systematic, rigorous procedure to search, select, and analyze primary studies available in the literature. Our corpus, as presented in this paper, is made up of twenty-two such studies, each presenting strategies and solutions on middleware support for energy efficiency and energy awareness in IoT systems. These strategies mainly focus on network adaptation, task offloading, and concrete implementations. However, most of these studies do not consider energy-aware/efficiency abstractions, and focus on solutions working at the end-user application side. In conclusion, this paper also raises relevant challenges and potential directions for further research resulting from the main SLR findings. © 2022, Institut Mines-Télécom and Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract  = {Actually, wireless sensor networks represent a substantial part in IoT. However, their limitation requires a special consideration in IoT applications. For their integration with the internet, it is necessary to adapt such networks using different middleware, with taking into account various challenges such as heterogeneity and interoperability. Previously Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) was the suitable design, but with a better practice, a new design called microservice becomes the leader due to its high performance and its suitability for IoT applications. In this paper, we first survey the most important middleware that have been proposed to handle WSN through IoT. Also, we discuss the most crucial microservices that handle different integration factors by making them supported by the proposed middleware. Our proposal is inspired from artificial neural network architecture to allow dynamic service interaction; it supports unlimited services with a regard to various device capabilities separately of the cloud technologies. Moreover, the evaluation of our design clearly shows that our middleware allows a lightweight WSN integration with IoT regarding to their limitations and requirements. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract  = {Following the trends of electrification, the energy storage of vehicles is gaining importance as the most expensive part of an electric car. Since lithium-ion batteries are perishable goods and underlie e. g. aging effects, environmental and operating conditions during manufacturing and car usage need close supervision. With regard to the paradigm of digital twins, data from various life cycle phases needs to be collected and processed to improve the general quality of the system. To achieve this complex task, a suitable framework is needed in order to operate the fleet of digital twins during manufacturing processes, the automotive usage and a potential second life. Based on a literature review, we formulate requirements for a digital twin framework in the field of battery systems. We propose a framework to develop and operate a fleet of digital twins during all life cycle phases. Results feature a case study in which we implement the stated framework in a cloud-computing environment using early stages of battery system production as test a bed. With the help of a self-discharge model of li-ion cells, the system can estimate the SOC of battery modules and provide this information to the arrival testing procedures. © 2019 ACM.},

The complexity and multimodality of human actors require specific interfaces for their integration with IoT frameworks that provide suitable software architectures, data models, protocols, message types, and applications. This study focuses on the requirements and design approaches for integrating human actors in a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) within the application domain of Industry 4.0. After a systematic review and taxonomy of the related research literature, the design and implementation of a comprehensive human-integration framework is presented as part of a multi-Agent IoT middleware called CHARIOT. Example applications that are developed to exploit the human integration capabilities of CHARIOT middleware are then presented, which extract data from human activities, enable multimodal interaction between humans and other IoT entities, and assist different human roles in a smart factory environment to satisfy the human-CPS integration requirements. © 2019 IEEE.},

Then, we cover the new standards (emerging after 2010) that introduced the new Integrated Broadcast Broadband (IBB) model, which combines broadcast signals with a broadband interface and leverages synergies to offer high-quality, flexible, interactive and customized services and applications to viewers. Regarding IBB systems, we also cover the main aspects of their architectures and innovations introduced by this kind of technology, such as support to companion devices, e.g., smartphones, tablets, targeted advertisements, and integration with Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices.

  abstract  = {Context-aware computing enriches the capabilities of intelligent devices complemented with smart applications and helps establish smart ecosystems in fields such as Ambient Intelligence, Internet of Things, Mobile Computing, and Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing. Though the literature has many surveys that outline existing systems, it still remains critical to elucidate the basics of actually building an effective context-aware ecosystem. We outline the basic components required and essential for the same. We believe that a context-aware ecosystem becomes effective when these components are designed and implemented effectively. We call it the MOM of context-aware systems: generic and effective context Modeling, an efficient context Organization, and a robust context Middleware. Context modeling affords a syntax to the raw pieces of relevant information, the organization mechanism furnishes semantic import to the information and relationships, and the middleware compiles and integrates the information, enabling sharing of context. We discuss various context-aware ecosystems and middleware from the literature and highlight how the three building components function in each case. This paper will benefit newcomers to the field who are looking to learn about and build context-aware ecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract  = {Purpose: Internet has changed radically in the way people interact in the virtual world, in their careers or social relationships. IoT technology has added a new vision to this process by enabling connections between smart objects and humans, and also between smart objects themselves, which leads to anything, anytime, anywhere, and any media communications. IoT allows objects to physically see, hear, think, and perform tasks by making them talk to each other, share information and coordinate decisions. To enable the vision of IoT, it utilizes technologies such as ubiquitous computing, context awareness, RFID, WSN, embedded devices, CPS, communication technologies, and internet protocols. IoT is considered to be the future internet, which is significantly different from the Internet we use today. The purpose of this paper is to provide up-to-date literature on trends of IoT research which is driven by the need for convergence of several interdisciplinary technologies and new applications. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive IoT literature review has been performed in this paper as a survey. The survey starts by providing an overview of IoT concepts, visions and evolutions. IoT architectures are also explored. Then, the most important components of IoT are discussed including a thorough discussion of IoT operating systems such as Tiny OS, Contiki OS, FreeRTOS, and RIOT. A review of IoT applications is also presented in this paper and finally, IoT challenges that can be recently encountered by researchers are introduced. Findings: Studies of IoT literature and projects show the disproportionate importance of technology in IoT projects, which are often driven by technological interventions rather than innovation in the business model. There are a number of serious concerns about the dangers of IoT growth, particularly in the areas of privacy and security; hence, industry and government began addressing these concerns. At the end, what makes IoT exciting is that we do not yet know the exact use cases which would have the ability to significantly influence our lives. Originality/value: This survey provides a comprehensive literature review on IoT techniques, operating systems and trends. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

  abstract  = {Satisfying a context consumer’s quality of context (QoC) requirements is of utmost importance to context management platforms (CMPs)in order to have credibility. QoC indicates the contextual information’s quality metrics (e.g., accuracy, timeliness, completeness). The outcomes of these metrics depend on the functional and quality characteristics associated with all actors (context consumers (or) context-aware applications, CMPs, and context providers (or) IoT-data providers) in context-aware ecosystems. This survey identifies and studies such characteristics and highlights the limitations in actors’ current functionalities and QoC modelling approaches to obtain adequate QoC and improve context consumers’ quality of experience (QoE). We propose an abstract system based on deductions from this study; this system addresses the functional limitations in existing QoC modelling approaches. Moreover, we have also highlighted those QoC metrics affected by quality of service (QoS) metrics in CMPs. These recommendations provide CMP developers with a reference framework they could incorporate and a list of QoS metrics that they need in order to maintain an adequate QoC. © 2022 by the authors.

These services require a large computing capacity to perform well, while often being under the constraints to move data from the edge of the network to the cloud. Also, they require system support to program reactions that occur at runtime, especially when the target infrastructure capacities and capabilities are unknown during the design. The core of this survey is a comprehensive review of existing components for Edge Computing and Internet of Things applications. In recent years, the landscape of the edge middleware platforms has grown exponentially with more than a hundred available solutions in academia and industry. Such platforms are required to provide necessary components for sensor registration, resource discovery, workflow composition, and data processing. In this regard, we surveyed existing solutions through the lens of a simplified three-layer architecture for the design of edge-based middleware, along with design goals for each of the proposed layers.

  abstract  = {Ubiquitous sensing, provided via wireless sensor networks technologies, disseminates across many domains of contemporary day living. This provides the ability to sense, process, analyze and infer environmental parameters from natural resources and delicate ecologies to urban environments. The explosion in the number of devices that are connected to the internet has led to the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) technological revolution. In these technologies, actuators and sensors incorporate smoothly with the IoT environment. Furthermore, the sensed data is shared through platforms to innovate a common operating picture. This cutting-edge technology is fueled by a diversity of IoT devices that enables technologies such as near field communication, embedded actuator, sensor nodes, radio frequency identification tags, and readers. IoT has emerged from its infancy and has established a fully integrated future internet. Different visions of IoT technologies have been reviewed, however, what emerges currently in this field should be faced and displayed via the research community. In this paper, we are keen to discuss the recent worldwide implementation of IoT, where the prime enabling technologies, recent and future communication protocols and application areas that drive IoT research in the near future are explored. Furthermore, the original, recent, future enhancements of all IoT stack's protocols are extensively discussed. Middleware's definition, usages, types and open research challenges are further illustrated. Not only to this extent but rather, this survey details the simulation tools of IoT networks, IoT sensors along with their recent application areas, broad IoT research challenges, as well as in-depth analysis of IoT research history and recommendations that attract current IoT researchers' attention. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract  = {Internet of Things (IoT) is highly heterogeneous in terms of devices, communication technologies, protocols, data formats, and semantics. Data generated from various sources are represented using different semantics. It makes semantic interoperability as one of the significant issues in provisioning seamless communication and services over diverse IoT platforms. Semantic models help in exchanging semantically annotated information among such heterogeneous applications in a meaningful way. Seamless communication among different types of applications is commonly accomplished by using middleware, ontology, and semantic web technologies. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of different semantic interoperability solutions in the context of IoT. The pivotal semantic models available in the literature are compared with the help of a classification framework. This study identifies various open research issues and challenges for facilitating interoperable IoT communications. For the purpose of implementation and performance evaluation of various semantic models, we also suggest some important tools and frameworks. After pointing out different prospects and problems of the existing semantic interoperability schemes, the factors for improvement are identified indicating future research directions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {Stream Processing (SP) has evolved as the leading paradigm to process and gain value from the high volume of streaming data produced, e.g., in the domain of the Internet of Things. An SP system is a middleware that deploys a network of operators between data sources, such as sensors, and the consuming applications. SP systems typically face intense and highly dynamic data streams. Parallelization and elasticity enable SP systems to process these streams with continuous high quality of service. The current research landscape provides a broad spectrum of methods for parallelization and elasticity in SP. Each method makes specific assumptions and focuses on particular aspects. However, the literature lacks a comprehensive overview and categorization of the state of the art in SP parallelization and elasticity, which is necessary to consolidate the state of the research and to plan future research directions on this basis. Therefore, in this survey, we study the literature and develop a classification of current methods for both parallelization and elasticity in SP systems. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

  abstract  = {Digital transformation in agriculture makes horse management technology available for farmers and veterinaries. This work compiles an overview of sensor systems currently available in Germany, discussing their usefulness and opportunities for improvement from a user's perspective. The systems have been identified by market and literature review and later categorized by their place of deployment, either in the stable, on the pasture or directly attached to the horse. Examples for subgroups show similar choices in technical specification like the built-in sensors, connectivity options and user interfaces. To gain further insights to the practicability of those systems, a survey has been conducted with German users of sensor systems in horse keeping. The questionnaire reflects on advantages and disadvantages in the use of the sensor systems. The results show that networking of the individual systems on farm-level would be desirable from the user's point of view. However, a solution that combines the different sensors and their data on farm level is not available. Thus, it is difficult for farmers to collect and aggregate their data. As a solution, open-source broker models are suggested, to act as middleware. They can integrate data from sensor-systems as well as external data sources. All the desired information can be displayed to end-users in customized user interfaces tailored to the individual stable or farm. With this kind of middleware, cyber-physical-systems can be built implementing a control-layer to automate tasks and documentation. Like this, farmers are supported to invest their know-how and time, only where it is most needed. © ASABE 2020 Annual International Meeting.},

  abstract  = {With the rapid evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the growth of IoT-generated data, cloud computing platforms have been widely used to store and process this type of data. However, cloud computing cannot handle rapidly emerging smart applications with latency-sensitive, high throughput, and high availability and reliability requirements, such as virtual reality and autonomous vehicles. The fog and mobile edge computing paradigms have been proposed to bring the cloud capacity along the network to end devices to address the above concerns. A key development aspect of fog systems is their programming models. Fog programming models and frameworks face challenges that originated from the unique characteristics of fog systems, such as heterogeneity, scalability, and mobility. In this paper, we first study the main characteristics of fog programming, as well as the design requirements of fog programming models with respect to the fog architecture and application types. Then, we survey fog programming models both from research and industry perspectives. Finally, we point out the issues and future challenges in fog programming. The survey framework, presented in this paper, provides useful insights and outlook for the fog programming research and development, inspires further research on fog programming models, and sheds light on the future of programming in this fast-growing computing paradigm. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

  abstract  = {This paper explores the relationship between five LM methods (JIT, TPM, Autonomation, VSM and Kaizen) and three IoT technologies (RFID, WSN and Middleware) and the implications that arise from their combination. Four hypotheses and four complimentary research questions were formulated and tested. 136 responses were obtained through a questionnaire survey and analysed using descriptive statistics, 2-Sample proportion, Kruskal-Wallis, ANOVA and Pairwise comparison tests. The findings indicate that IoT can significantly improve the operational performance of manufacturing organisations. The findings advocate that all LM methods, apart from Kaizen, benefit from improved effectiveness by combining them with IoT. The results suggest that this can be attributed to the general perception about IoT, which despite the support and benefits it provides to people, is seen to be reducing human involvement whereas Kaizen is seen to be more people-focused. Improvements in information flow, decision-making and productivity were also found to be the most important motivations and benefits of combining LM methods with IoT. The findings of this research can be used by LM organisations that wish to embark into the new digitalised manufacturing era and businesses seeking to improve their performance through the combination of traditional efficiency-based methods and I4.0 technologies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract          = {Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology that not only serves to identify objects but also communicates other information, allowing the real-time monitoring of objects at each step in a mobile object network and the reporting of information on their current status. RFID has become one of the most promising research areas and has attracted increasing attention. This interest sparks a huge amount of literature in the field of RFID. However, the research has been conducted from different perspectives and, as a result, has led to a growing body of knowledge dispersed in different fields. To fill this gap, we carried out a systematic mapping study (SMS) based on a well-established research methodology from the medical and software engineering scientific communities, which aims to study and identify the approaches used, quantity and quality of publications, types of research, and publication trends that shaped the field of RFID research over the past two decades. Its results were based on 219 studies, rigorously selected from among 4294 studies identified in the IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science digital libraries and classified according to the research type facet, research area facet, citation facet, and application domain facet. We synthesized and interpreted the results of this SMS to devise future research directions in the RFID domain. This breadth-first SMS provides a solid, comprehensive, and reproducible picture of state-of-the-art RFID technology; the obtained results may have implications for practitioners willing to understand and adopt RFID, including researchers, journal editors, reviewers, and universities. The results obtained revealed that (1) there is a considerable and continuous rise of RFID research activities around different parts of the globe, including in the USA and China, and other English-speaking developed countries, such as Australia, Canada, and the U.K., have a significant influence on this growth; (2) with the technological progress of RFID hardware components and increasingly demanding application domains, RFID technology brings opportunities in some new areas, such as 'IoT applications', 'Complex Environments', and 'Industry 4.0'; (3) despite the high number of studies carried out in the field of RFID, especially in the hardware design and performances subfield, a limited number of works have detailed or focused on the 'middleware' component of RFID systems, indicating that RFID data processing and management remain an open research issue; and (4) RFID domain challenges, gaps, and feasible future recommendations were highlighted in this study.  © 2021 IEEE.},

  abstract          = {Although Internet of Things (IoT) devices have made our lives increasingly convenient, there have been many reports of vulnerabilities, such as information leakage and use of these devices as springboards for attacks. To detect vulnerabilities in IoT devices, many vulnerability detection methods using firmware analysis have been proposed by many researches. The general flow of vulnerability detection is to load firmware into an analysis program called an SRE (software reverse engineering) tool and then apply the original algorithm of each program under study to find vulnerabilities. However, firmware analysis requires complex analysis preparation before applying proprietary algorithms, and the development cost of analysis preparation is burdensome for researchers. In this study, we surveyed research on firmware vulnerability detection. We chose ten studies on vulnerability detection. The results of our survey showed that the commonly used functions for firmware analysis are firmware splitting, static strings, graphs, and network functions. Also despite the fact that many studies use similar functions, all of them were developed by each study. According to the survey result, we propose a middleware that standardizes analysis preparation. By using our middleware, researchers do not need to develop a basic function of finding vulnerability. This ability will reduce the development cost of preparing for analysis and allow researchers to spend more time developing vulnerability detection algorithms, which is this project’s original purpose. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The challenge comes from the huge number of candidates available today. The present work aims to relieve IT developers of the need to take charge of the IoT platform selection process. A systematic mapping study (SMS) was carried out. The final finding was that, at present, ThingsBoard is the most mature open-source IoT platform to be used for the prototyping of IoT applications without having to be an expert programmer. © 2023 by the author.},

  abstract          = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a complex ecosystem of connected devices that exchange data over a wired or wireless network and whose final aim is to provide services either to humans or machines. The IoT has seen rapid development over the past decade. The total number of installed connected devices is expected to grow exponentially in the near future, since more and more domains are looking for IoT solutions. As a consequence, an increasing number of developers are approaching IoT technology for the first time. Unfortunately, the number of IoT-related studies published every year is becoming huge, with the obvious consequence that it would be impossible for anyone to predict the time that could be necessary to find a paper talking about a given problem at hand. This is the reason why IoT-related discussions have become predominant in various practitioners’ forums, which moderate thousands of posts each month. The present paper’s contribution is twofold. First, it aims at providing a holistic overview of the heterogeneous IoT world by taking into account a technology perspective and a business perspective. For each topic taken into account, a tutorial introduction (deliberately devoid of technical content to make this document within the reach of non-technical readers as well) is provided. Then, a table of very recent review papers is given for each topic, as the result of a systematic mapping study. © 2022 by the authors.},

The development of AAL platforms presents several challenges (e.g., sensor data integration, device interoperability). Many requirements for AAL platforms can be met by using the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing paradigm standards. METHODOLOGY: In this paper, we conducted a systematic mapping of the literature on AAL platforms to investigate the correlation between these three paradigms. We focused on AAL platforms that use IoT and Cloud Computing concepts to meet their requirements. Our primary research question is "What are the requirements of AAL platforms in the IoT Era and their relationship with IoT standards?". We defined as the scope of our systematic mapping the primary studies about AAL platforms published between 2013 to 2017, and we used seven indexed electronic databases. RESULTS: We obtained 35 papers whose AAL platforms developed using IoT or Cloud Computing standards. We then analyse and correlate the requirements, architectures, and evaluation types presented by these platforms. We found patterns by connecting specific requirements with platform design. We believe these results assist AAL developers and architectural designers in the creation of new AAL platforms and applications.},

The elasticity of Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) enables numerous applications to exchange information makes it a significant middleware layer responsible for transferring information in a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). ESB is presently the utmost promising tactic for the integration of business applications in distributed and diverse environments. It also offers essential infrastructure support for transforming messages or data, intelligent routing, and protocol transformation. The idea of ESBs emerged from the requirements to move out from traditional integration patterns, that becomes difficult to manage with the passage of time. Our study aim is to understand and provide ongoing research topics, challenges and future directions concerning ESB applications. A systematic mapping study (SMS) is therefore implemented to categorize the selected papers into the following classification: contribution type, ESB applications, research type and their approaches. We have extracted a total of twenty-two papers for this systematic study and they are classified according to defined criteria. The findings of this SMS are discussed and researchers were provided with suggestions on possible directions for future research.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: RFID or Radio Frequency Identification is a technology for identifying objects or people. It is based on the use of radio waves to remotely read the data written on RFID transponder, commonly called an RFID tag. This technology has become one of the most promising research areas and has attracted growing interest, hence the need for a scoping review of this research field. OBJECTIVE: We intend to carry out a systematic map as part of a scoping review to clarify and show the current state of existing studies in the RFID area. METHOD: We followed the scoping review process defined by Petersen et al. [1] [2], based on a well-established research methodology from the medical and software engineering scientific communities. 219 primary studies were selected rigorously, subsequently a classification framework was applied to extract key information for further analysis. We synthesized the resulting data and produced a clear state-of-the-art. RESULTS: We outline the process of a Scoping Review applied to the field of RFID technology from a software engineering perspective. On this basis, this work contributes with (1) a general framework for classifying information on published studies in this disciplinary field, (2) a presentation of current research in the RFID field in a systematic map form, (3) a discussion of emerging results and their implications for future research. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review provides an overview of the RFID field and, more importantly, identifies research gaps and future research directions for researchers, practitioners interested in RFID technology, reviewers and universities, and journal editors. One of the findings is that, although there is a lot of research being conducted in this area, a limited amount of work is focused on the problem of RFID data acquisition and processing, or in other words, on the “middleware” component of RFID systems.},

This is due to their practical capabilities in solving many issues currently inhibiting further advances in various industrial domains. Securely recording and sharing transactional data, establishing automated and efficient supply chain processes, and enhancing transparency across the whole value chain are some examples of these issues. Blockchain offers an effective way to tackle these issues using distributed, shared, secure, and permissioned transactional ledgers. The employment of blockchain technologies and the possibility of applying them in different situations enables many industrial applications through increased efficiency and security; enhanced traceability and transparency; and reduced costs. In this paper, different industrial application domains where the use of blockchain technologies has been proposed are reviewed. This paper explores the opportunities, benefits, and challenges of incorporating blockchain in different industrial applications. Furthermore, the paper attempts to identify the requirements that support the implementation of blockchain for different industrial applications. The review reveals that several opportunities are available for utilizing blockchain in various industrial sectors; however, there are still some challenges to be addressed to achieve better utilization of this technology.},

Scholars agree that the implementation of Smart Factory leads to the creation of value. We identify a research gap which is related to the make-or-buy decision around some core components of the Smart Factory, especially the Digital Twin (DT). We argue that the effectiveness of value creation depends on the "way" in which Smart Factory is implemented. Firms are required to decide if an implementation project will be executed in-house or through external supplier. In addition, we analysed the research gap through the theoretical lens of Transaction Costs Economics (TCE).},

New actors that aim to remotely monitor and control home devices such as heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), light bulbs, or distributed energy resources (e.g., batteries, PV panels…) have come into play. However, transitioning from isolated often not interoperable home automation systems to open, yet secure, solutions that integrate external sources of information and cloud computing to make a more efficient use of energy, is not trivial. It requires designing and implementing hierarchical architectures and standard solutions to facilitate interoperability, one of the challenges of cross-domain smart-city applications as no standard solution has been established yet. Even though most solutions share a set of building blocks that have fostered the appearance of Internet of Things (IoT) middlewares to accelerate development, most existing energy platforms are still tailor-made for specific applications. This paper targets three audiences. First, for those interested in using or selecting an energy platform, the study carries out a comparative analysis of some of the most popular alternatives. Second, for those that are considering building new energy platforms, this paper analyzes the necessary hierarchical blocks, and the main design options and strategies. Finally, for those interested in comparing platforms, a new set of IoT levels that evaluate the adoption of IoT technologies is proposed.},

  abstract  = {Mobile cloud computing (MCC) is an extension of cloud computing (CC) technologies. It provides seamless access of different cloud services to smart mobile devices (SMDs). There is no denying that CC can be scaled to a great extent in terms of computing, storage and other services, but the SMDs used for accessing those services are limited on battery capacity, storage and computing power due to their small form factors. The limitations of SMDs can be minimised/resolved by using MCC platforms. Though MCC is advantageous in many ways, it has its own inherent challenges and issues due to the heterogeneous hardware and software platforms used by SMDs and CC platforms, which makes it difficult to have interoperable services and the development of applications for those devices. This paper studied recently (from 2012 onwards) proposed/developed middlewares for the Internet of things (IoT), cloud of things (CoT), context-aware middlewares (CaMs) and mobile cloud middlewares (MCMs). Different middleware architectures are chosen, as in many cases, these technologies converge in terms of features, functions and services they provide. The study finds that the present middlewares lack in providing an integrated solution that complies with interoperability, portability, adaptability, context awareness, security and privacy, service discovery, fault tolerance requirements. At the end of the paper, the challenges pertaining to achieve portability, interoperability, context awareness, security are discussed and identify the gaps in the existing approaches in MCC interoperability and context adaptability.},

Currently, IoT applications are used in wide range of sectors like healthcare, industrial, smart cities, etc. This application having different characteristics like real-time, diverse applications, and everything as a service. Middleware is key part or layer of IoT architecture. Middleware is software component that provides communication between devices and application. It provides the interface between heterogeneous devices and IoT application. Actually, Middleware supports many features like heterogeneity, reliability, availability, mobility, scalability, intelligence, privacy, and security. Recently, many proposals for IoT middleware are proposed based on their design types and architecture. The review presented in this paper contains in depth comparison between different service-oriented middleware. In addition of summary, we also explore research challenges, open issues, and research directions in era of service-oriented middleware.},

This work mainly focused on Social Internet of Things ecosystem and its design to efficiently handle large group social gatherings, events, and emergency service management. We propose a layered message transfer framework for the social IoT scenario. We also establish network connection through flying ad hoc network architecture. The standard IoT message transfer protocol is redesigned by amalgamating with an opportunistic routing mechanism and deployed within 6G software-defined network (SDN) slice. We use seven distinguished network slices for different services and corresponding access. The study reveals nearly 99% of message delivery rate with a latency upper bound of 2300 ms by opportunistic message transfer scheme in a dense network scenario for QoS 2. It also shows 95% of the bandwidth utilization per slice and 97% of network coverage under SDN in quality of service level 2.},

The implementation of IoT technologies leverages seamless integration of the cyber and physical worlds, radically altering and empowering human interaction. Middleware, commonly described as a software system designed to be the intermediary between IoT devices and applications, is a fundamental technology in developing IoT systems. The IoT middleware solutions must match the requirements of the IoT ecosystem to acquire the widespread adoption. Among various approaches to middleware, service-oriented approach (SOA) is most suitable. Extending advantages of SOA, the special case of service orientation paradigm called microservices approach that has created a hype in the domain of cloud and enterprise application business. Furthermore, the microservices model has several advantages, particularly in dynamic IoT applications, where it is highly straightforward to utilize microservices-based architectures. This paper provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art and practice regarding the usage of microservice architectures by IoT.

Indeed, IoT-based solutions are poised to transform how we keep people safe and healthy especially as the demand for solutions to lower healthcare costs increases in the coming years. However, the heterogeneity of the things that can be connected in such environments makes interoperability among them a challenging problem. Moreover, the observations produced by these things are made available with various vocabularies and data formats. This heterogeneity prevents generic solutions from being adopted on a global scale and makes difficult to share and reuse data for other purposes than those for which they were initially set up. In this book chapter, we provide an overview of the different solutions from both technical and semantic perspectives that have been used recently to tackle the interoperability issue in such IoT environments and especially in healthcare domain.

In the past decade, the academia, industry 4.0 and end-user interest has also grown drastically in IoT applications and their services. However, this increase in IoT services demand has witnessed a new challenge of seamless interaction among heterogeneous devices that are varied, diverse and dynamic in nature. In this connection, another challenge is tracing the footprint of these IoT interactions for trust-based interactions, that further becomes complex with the introduction of new applications. For instance, in many situations, IoT services are generally not self-contained and sufficient. They need to coordinate and interact with other IoT services held in the surroundings. The large-scale deployment of IoT based services is not conceivable without addressing interoperability and services coordination related challenges. In this regard, a comprehensive set of tools and techniques associated with IoT heterogeneity and interoperability have been explored. This article proposes a middleware framework to consider IoT heterogeneity and interoperability issues in different service interactions. Later, the article investigates experimentally, the trust measurements among IOTs, their decay, and the effectiveness of dynamic selection of trust parameters along with their thresholds. Appropriateness of time intervals have also been tested in various types of service interactions. To demonstrate middleware applicability, the trust-based algorithm has been applied in a service-oriented environment along with different types of services.},

Most of the research on context-aware middleware for IoT addresses a specific domain and limited kinds of applications. Realizing the ultimate intelligence and automation in IoT will need a multiple-domain system. The architectural design of a multiple-domain context-aware middleware for IoT and pervasive computing envisages serious challenges, including extensibility of the environment, need for distribution, resource limitation of mobile devices, mobility, and need for unique name allocation, which have not been fully addressed by related studies. This paper proposes the architectural design of a multiple-domain context-aware middleware (CAMID), which uses a distributed two-layer architecture to handle the above issues. CAMID has been developed in Java in two layers, including H-CAMID and L-CAMID. Scenario-based Architecture Analysis Method (SAAM) shows that CAMID satisfies the target quality attributes and outperforms previous multiple-domain solutions. Finally, an experimental evaluation of CAMID shows acceptable response time in a critical scenario.},

At present, market is overwhelming with the number of IoT middleware platforms with specific features. This raises one of the most serious and least discussed challenges for application developer to choose suitable platform for their application development. Across the literature, very little attempt is done in classifying or comparing IoT middleware platforms for the applications. This paper categorizes IoT platforms into four categories, namely publicly traded, open-source, developer-friendly and end-to-end connectivity. Some of the popular middleware platforms in each category are investigated based on general IoT architecture. Comparison of IoT middleware platforms in each category, based on basic, sensing, communication and application development features, is presented.

To detect vulnerabilities in IoT devices, many vulnerability detection methods using firmware analysis have been proposed by many researches. The general flow of vulnerability detection is to load firmware into an analysis program called an SRE (software reverse engineering) tool and then apply the original algorithm of each program under study to find vulnerabilities. However, firmware analysis requires complex analysis preparation before applying proprietary algorithms, and the development cost of analysis preparation is burdensome for researchers. In this study, we surveyed research on firmware vulnerability detection. We chose ten studies on vulnerability detection. The results of our survey showed that the commonly used functions for firmware analysis are firmware splitting, static strings, graphs, and network functions. Also despite the fact that many studies use similar functions, all of them were developed by each study. According to the survey result, we propose a middleware that standardizes analysis preparation. By using our middleware, researchers do not need to develop a basic function of finding vulnerability. This ability will reduce the development cost of preparing for analysis and allow researchers to spend more time developing vulnerability detection algorithms, which is this project’s original purpose.},

In addition, a case study is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the evaluation method.},

  abstract  = {Recent advances in robotics technology have made it viable to assign complex tasks to large numbers of inexpensive robots. The robots as an ensemble form into a multi-robot system (MRS), which can be utilized for many applications where a single robot is not efficient or feasible. MRS can be used for a wide variety of application domains such as military, agriculture, smart home, disaster relief, etc. It offers higher scalability, reliability, and efficiency as compared to single-robot system. However, it is nontrivial to develop and deploy MRS applications due to many challenging issues such as distributed computation, collaboration, coordination, and real-time integration of robotic modules and services. To make the development of multi-robot applications easier, researchers have proposed various middleware architectures to provide programming abstractions that help in managing the complexity and heterogeneity of hardware and applications. With the help of middleware, an application developer can concentrate on the high-level logic of applications instead of worrying about low-level hardware and network details. In this chapter, we survey state of the art in both distributed MRS and middleware being used for developing their applications. We provide a taxonomy that can be used to classify the MRS middleware and analyze existing middleware functionalities and features. Our work will help researchers and developers in the systematic understanding of middleware for MRS and in selecting or developing the appropriate middleware based on the application requirements.},

  abstract  = {One of the biggest challenges in a Smart City is how to describe and dispose of the enormous and multiple sources of information, and how to share and merge it into a single infrastructure, in a timely and correct manner. A Smart City requires computational platforms, which allow the interconnection of multiple and embedded systems, such that the technology is integrated with people, and can respond to unpredictable situations. The integration of information and communications technology in these spaces, allows exploiting the wealth of information and knowledge generated in a Smart City, and improving its planning and services offered to its citizens. In this way, the people are immersed in these spaces, which are aware of their presence (context-sensitive) and adapt to their needs. The context analysis in a smart city allows making available services and information, to support ubiquitously the activities of the individuals. This study aims to analyze the emerging and ubiquitous capabilities of an Autonomic Reflective Middleware. The Middleware is based on intelligent agents that can be adapted to the existing dynamism in a city for, ubiquitously, responding to the requirements of citizens. It uses emerging ontologies that allow, not only the adaptation to the context of the moment and in real-time but also responds to unforeseen situations.},

This project is divided into three main phases, the design and implementation of the home automation system, the development of the graphic interface for DTT and the communication protocol between these two areas. For the automation phase, six areas are covered: intrusion alarms, technical alarms, lighting control, blinds and shades control, access to cameras, and pre-programmed scenarios. To meet the requirements of these six areas, a controller with different sensors and actuators are installed providing a safe, comfortable and controlled environment. The user interface, designed as an interactive TV application based on the Ginga middleware, is the way to represent the automation devices installed, therefore the user can visualize the status of each sensor and take action on its actuators. In addition, a mobile user application was implemented to provide interoperability and usability in multiple devices. The communication protocol is developed in order to manage data sent from the application through TCP communication; and by means of a translator the information is redirected to a Real-Time cloud database, where the controller has access to complete the communication between both parties. Testing of operation and Start-up of the automation system is carried out, in addition to the application usability tests on several devices. The final system resulted in an integrated, robust and reliable system in terms of operation; and friendly and intuitive to the user.},

  abstract  = {The dramatic development of Edge Computing technologies is strongly stimulating the adoption of machine learning models on connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) so that they can provide a variety of intelligent onboard services. When multiple services running on the resource-constrained CAVs, how limited resources can dynamically support the desired services is of the utmost importance for both automakers and domain researchers. In this context, efficiently and dynamically managing vehicle services becomes critical for autonomous driving. While previous research focused on service scheduling, computation offloading, and virtual machine migration, we propose EdgeWare, an extensible and flexible middleware to manage the execution of vehicle services, which is open-source to the community with four key features: i) on-demand model switch, i.e., easily switch and upgrade machine learning models, ii) function consolidation and deduplication to eliminate duplicate copies of repeating functions and maximize the reusability of vehicle services, iii) build event-driven applications to reduce workload, and iv) dynamic workflow customization which enables customizing workflow to extend the functionality. Our experiment results show that EdgeWare accelerates the execution of services about 2.6 faster compared to the silo approach and save CPU and memory utilization up to around 50% and 17% respectively, and it allows domain researchers to dynamically add new services on CAVs or easily switch to the upgraded applications for the life cycle management of vehicle services.},

  abstract          = {The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) offers promising ways to meet healthcare needs of patients recovering in their own homes and other environments. Interconnected and resilient smart systems offer innovative and cost-effective ways of supporting patients by capitalizing on available devices and networking infrastructure. However, future environments will not be uniformly smart, and there will be asymmetries where our environments’ (home, work, etc.) resources and capabilities differ. Technological solutions will need to adapt to such asymmetries and provide high-quality service and equitable healthcare. This article presents a systematic mapping study that explores opportunities and challenges in building next-generation IoMT smart systems for future environments. The study spans academic literature published in the decade from 2011 to 2021, profiling it from three distinct perspectives: Smart Systems, Future Environments, and Tech-Assisted Health. Each perspective was explored via a Domain Expert-Driven Systematic Mapping protocol to establish where the research is focused and to identify research gaps. From an initial search of 495 studies, 113 were mapped to a set of predefined ontology classes, spanning 6 strategic focus categories. The mapping identified sensing technologies for medical vitals and sensor fusion technologies to combine measurements for more complex analysis, cloud platforms, and connectivity challenges; health conditions that have received the most attention in healthcare smart systems; issues and opportunities in handling large data volumes in integrated smart systems; as well as security and privacy challenges. We find that future middleware frameworks will require a greater degree of interoperability and maturity to fully deliver value. Promising middleware and integration frameworks will require significant adaption and refinement to coexist effectively with current healthcare technologies. Privacy and security are critical factors in healthcare but are currently poorly supported by IoT infrastructures, especially across multiple environments. © 2023 by the authors.},

We queried the Scopus database looking for articles that mention ThingsBoard either in the Title, in the Abstract, or among the authors' Keywords. 55 items were retrieved and carefully read. At the end of this stage, we were able to answer the following research questions: Are there available studies mentioning ThingsBoard? In which ambits? What is the role of ThingsBoard in the studies where it is mentioned? What are the gaps in current research and the implications for future research? The study goals are general, so the final findings might be of interest to IoT professionals, as well as to scholars. In detail, the SMS provides insights into the breadth of usage and the domains where ThingsBoard has been applied successfully, indicating its suitability and potential for a wide range of IoT-related projects. Moreover, a few gaps to be filled with further research have emerged. © 2024 Paolino Di Felice and Gaetanino Paolone.

However, the development of effective middleware for smart cities is challenging. The present research embarks on a comprehensive exploration of the smart city middleware landscape, unraveling the intricacies of its development and the challenges faced therein. Rooted in the assessment of 20 distinct middleware solutions, our study highlights the pivotal technologies, features and functionalities that are imperative for a middleware to effectively support a city’s digital transformation. The functional and non-functional requirements form the nucleus of our evaluation. We also explore the architectural styles pivotal to middleware development and the programming paradigms shaping smart city application development. Our study highlights challenges in using middleware for smart city applications, such as interoperability, scalability, security amidst big data, context management, reliability, quality of service, energy efficiency, and compliance with technological standards and regulations. Based on the detailed analysis, we propose a conceptual framework for smart city middleware, shaped by the challenges and requirements identified in existing literature and middleware solutions. This framework is designed to reflect the diverse demands and complexities of urban digital transformation, and guide smart city middleware development accordingly. As a result, this research stands as a reference study for software developers, urban planners, and researchers, outlining the current state and future directions in the domain of smart city middleware.},
